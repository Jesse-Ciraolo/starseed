	<h3>Opening the Lion's Mouth</h3>
	<text>There was once a boy that attempted to rip the jaws of a mighty lion wide open. It didn't seem like he could succeed. He figured out that he needed to be a woman, so then she was. She learned it was much easier to gently open the jaws, rather than pry them open with sheer force. The lion was docile and compliant, until it began closing its jaws once again. The now woman nearly prevents her hands from being destroyed, and is frustrated. She was at a loss. The next day her friend the Hermit came along. He said: "My dear Strength, I can open this lion's jaws with ease." And just as if he'd cast a spell, Strength could easily pry open the jaws once again.
